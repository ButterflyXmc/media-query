        <h2>Getting INFLATION back to NORMAL</h2>
        <img id="inf" src="https://telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inflation.jpg" alt="img">
        <p>Speaking a day after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers discusses where the economy stands and what the Bank is doing to get inflation back under control.</p>

        <h3>Our policy rate decision</h3>
        <p>We decided to raise the policy interest rate by 75 basis points to 3.25% and continue quantitative tightening.</p>

        <h3>The Canadian economy is running hot</h3>
        <p>Over the summer, the consumer price index dropped slightly—to 7.6% in July from 8.1% in June.
            While overall inflation may have peaked, most of the drop was due to gasoline prices. Inflation has continued to rise and broaden across goods and services. And globally, we're still seeing supply chain bottlenecks and high commodity prices, both of which contribute to inflation here in Canada.</p>

        <h3>Interest rate increases take time to work</h3>
        <p>We know that, for many Canadians, higher rates add to the burden they already face with high inflation. Still, we need to raise interest rates to bring inflation down.

            Inflation won't come down overnight. Monetary policy works like a chain reaction or sequence of events—a sequence that takes time. Changes to the Bank’s policy rate affect different households and sectors of the economy differently and at different speeds.</p>
